# Homework #4

Total Points: 20

Due: Thursday, May 22, 5:30pm CT

The aims of this assignment are:

1. To ensure your JS skills have gained proficiency
2. To verify that our tour of React has helped you think about state and overall modularity, even in non-React code.


### The Challenge

For this assignment, we will build a small app that uses the API at https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

I've already provided starter code for both the plain JS solution (js-recipes) or a React-based solution (react-recipes).

Both have the Bootstrap framework already applied, but you're free to switch to another framework or write your own CSS altogether.

**You only need to solve ONE of them: either js-recipes or reach-recipes.**  

Please indicate which one you chose to solve by simply deleting the subfolder 
of the other (i.e. if you choose to implement js-recipes, then use `git rm react-recipes`) or by 
editing this README.MD file and insert a note at the top of this file telling us which one we should grade.**


**REQUIREMENTS (20 points):**

Use the target.pdf file as a guide on how the UI should genearlly look and behave.  
You are free to use whatever fonts/colors you would like!

**Each feature below is worth 3 points. Solve them in any order that you feel best.**

* A home page where users can search for recipes 
* A search results list those shows the search results (maximum 5)
* A details view of a single recipe
* The ability to bookmark a recipe
* A view of all of the bookmarked recipes that uses the same display as the search results display

Plus up to 5 points for overall look and feel: it should look nice and be easy to use on a mobile device. 

Happy coding!
