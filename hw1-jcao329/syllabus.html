<h1> Syllabus</h1>
<h2> Course Description</h2>
<p><b>IMPORTANT: This section is somewhat different than other sections of MPCS 52553 in 2024, with less emphasis on back-end development.  We will focus on areas of web architecture that are also applicable to other kinds of tech stacks.</p></b>
<p>This course is intended to prepare students with a general programming background to work on teams producing modern web applications. Students will learn a strong foundation of core web technologies and protocols, an overview of the major design patterns in the history of web development, and a detailed introduction to the current industry standard. We will have an emphasis on learning from publicly-available documentation so that students are equipped to learn new techniques and frameworks in this rapidly-evolving field.</p>
<p>Specifically, the course will cover content layout and styling with HTML and CSS, asynchronous programming models, constraints of single-threaded event-driven programming, interacting with remote resources using HTTP and REST, client-side interactivity with modern Javascript, and the creation of single-page applications with Javascript frameworks like React.</p>
<p>This course uses agile software techniques to build real, working software each week. We will work as closely as possible on how software is developed in the industry, and all work is asynchronous, open-note, and open-internet, with collaboration, encouraged.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: This section is online but attendance is paramount.  Lectures are generally NOT available as a recording.  Students who must miss a class due to illness are encouraged to catch up on material from classmates.</p></b>
